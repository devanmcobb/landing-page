# odin-landing-page
Second project in TOP. I'll be creating an entire web page from a design provided. The design is in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors used. Objective is to get the landing page as close as I can to the design, but don't worry about getting it pixel-perfect.
